# Altify

**Web Equality starts here.**
Our mission: empower content creators, businesses, and web developers to provide meaningful alternative text (alt text) for images that can be read aloud, making the internet a more inclusive space!

**What does Altify do?**
Altify allows users to upload an image and receive an auto-generated and narrated alt text for that image. Our website uses image segmentation to classify objects, and then it reads a sentence out loud explaining what could be in the image.

**What was our Inspiration?**
We were inspired to help people who have visual impairments or use screen readers, so we built a program that allowed for them to see and hear the alt text of an image.

**What were some things we learned?**
We learned how to use pre-trained models to predict images and how to synchronize things in JavaScript. Additionally, we delved into the implementation of text-to-speech technology, gaining a deep appreciation for the significance of catering to diverse user needs and advancing accessibility on the internet.
